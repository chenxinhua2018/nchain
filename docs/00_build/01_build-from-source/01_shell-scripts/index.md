[[info | Did you know?]]
| Shell scripts automate the process of building, installing, testing, and uninstalling the EOSIO software and dependencies.

To build nchain from the source code using shell scripts, visit the sections below:

1. [Download nchain Source](01_download-nchain-source.md)
2. [Build nchain Binaries](02_build-nchain-binaries.md)

[[info | Building nchain is for Advanced Developers]]
| If you are new to nchain, it is recommended that you install the [nchain Prebuilt Binaries](../../00_install-prebuilt-binaries.md) instead of building from source.
